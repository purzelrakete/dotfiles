If you've come straight to the issue tracker out of habit, you might want to read the [Getting Help](http://ensime.github.io/getting_help/) or [ENSIME-Vim Troubleshooting](http://ensime.github.io/editors/vim/troubleshooting/) sections of the documentation.

If it still looks like a client bug and you've come back here, be aware that there is very little we can do unless you provide us with a reproduction of the problem:

1. a public (ideally minimal) project on github
2. step by step instructions to trigger the bug
3. commit your `.ensime` into the repository (or in a gist)
4. commit all your server / client logs into the repository (or in a gist).

The next step is for us to help you create a test that fails. You may want to get a head start by reading the [Contributing](http://ensime.github.io/contributing/) documentation. You have all the skills you'll need to make ENSIME & the Vim client even better.

We'll give as much help as we can, our goal is to grow this community.
