# -----------------
# list comprehensions
# -----------------

# basics:

a = ['' for a in [1]]
#? str()
a[0]
#? ['insert']
a.insert

a = [a for a in [1]]
#? int()
a[0]

y = 1.0
# Should not leak.
[y for y in [3]]
#? float()
y

a = [a for a in (1, 2)]
#? int()
a[0]

a = [a for a,b in [(1,'')]]
#? int()
a[0]

arr = [1,'']
a = [a for a in arr]
#? int() str()
a[0]

a = [a if 1.0 else '' for a in [1] if [1.0]]
#? int() str()
a[0]

# name resolve should be correct
left, right = 'a', 'b'
left, right = [x for x in (left, right)]
#? str()
left

# with a dict literal
#? str()
[a for a in {1:'x'}][0]

##? str()
{a-1:b for a,b in {1:'a', 3:1.0}.items()}[0]

# with a set literal
#? int()
[a for a in {1, 2, 3}][0]

#? set()
{a for a in range(10)}

##? int()
[x for x in {a for a in range(10)}][0]

##? int()
{a for a in range(10)}.pop()

##? int()
iter({a for a in range(10)}).next()


# list comprehensions should also work in combination with functions

    for x in arg:

# nested list comprehensions
# -----------------

# -----------------
# generator comprehensions
# -----------------

# -----------------
# name resolution in comprehensions.
